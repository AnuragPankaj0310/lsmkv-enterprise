> Inspired by RocksDB, LevelDB, Cassandra, and Redis internals.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is educational: to understand how modern storage engines and distributed key-value stores are built internally while keeping the implementation small enough to study.
LSMKV is **not** a wrapper around an existing database. It implements the core
technology that powers modern databases from scratch:

```
Storage Engine (RocksDB internals)
+ Distributed Layer (Cassandra-style sharding + replication)
+ Caching Concepts (Redis-style in-memory MemTable)
```

---

## Features

- WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)
- MemTable (in-memory write buffer with TTL & tombstones)
- SSTables (immutable sorted files with sparse index)
- Bloom Filter (prevents unnecessary disk reads)
- Background Compaction (K-way merge, tombstone GC)
- Consistent Hashing (client-side routing)
- Synchronous Replication (configurable replication factor)
- Heartbeat Failure Detection
- Docker Deployment (docker-compose)
- Prometheus Metrics & Grafana Dashboard
- Benchmark Suite


## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11
- asyncio
- MessagePack
- SortedContainers
- Docker
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- pytest


## Architecture

```
Client SDK
    │  consistent hash ring — routes directly, no coordinator
    │
    ├──► Node 0  (Primary for key range A-F)
    ├──► Node 1  (Primary for key range G-N)
    └──► Node 2  (Primary for key range O-Z)

Per-Node Storage Engine:
    Write: SET → WAL.append → MemTable.set → [flush when full] → SSTable
    Read:  GET → MemTable → Bloom filter → Sparse index → SSTable scan
    BG:    Compaction (K-way merge, tombstone GC, bounded SSTable count)
```

## Roadmap

### v1.1
- Request forwarding (client-side coordination for forwarded reads/writes)
- Multi-entry request routing
- Dynamic sharding and load-aware rebalancing
- Load balancing hooks and metrics-driven placement

### Future
- Block Cache
- Compression
- Range Queries
- Skip List MemTable
- Merkle Trees for anti-entropy
- Go/C++ storage engine rewrite


## Storage Engine Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Write Amplification | disk bytes / client bytes — compaction overhead |
| Read Amplification | SSTables read per logical GET |
| Bloom Filter Hit Rate | fraction of SSTable lookups skipped without disk I/O |
| SSTable Count | total files per level — compaction health signal |
| Compaction Throughput | bytes merged per second during compaction |
| MemTable Flush Count | number of MemTable flushes to SSTables |

---

## Interview Talking Points

- **"I implemented an LSM-tree storage engine from scratch"** — MemTable for writes, flushed to immutable SSTables, WAL for crash recovery.
- **"Each SSTable has a sparse index"** — binary search to the right byte offset, then sequential scan. No full file reads.
- **"I built a custom Bloom Filter using double hashing and a bytearray bit array"** — before any SSTable disk read, the filter catches 99% of missing keys.
- **"I assigned a monotonically increasing sequence number to every write, allowing deterministic conflict resolution during reads and compaction instead of relying on SSTable creation order."**
- **"Compaction performs a K-way merge across SSTables while keeping the record with the highest sequence number for every key and removing obsolete versions."** — removes duplicates and tombstones. I measured write amplification before and after tuning thresholds.
- **"Routing logic lives in the client SDK"** — the client knows the consistent hash ring and routes directly. No single point of failure.
- **"I benchmarked against Redis"** — LSMKV does ~18k ops/sec. Benchmarked LSMKV against Redis across multiple workloads to understand the performance impact of Python, disk I/O, Bloom filtering, and synchronous replication. The gap comes from Python overhead, disk I/O, and replication. I profiled each bottleneck.
- **"I chose synchronous replication"** — the guarantee is clean and explainable. The trade-off (write latency) is documented in design_decisions.md.
- **"I implemented a MANIFEST file that acts as the storage engine's checkpoint**", allowing fast recovery by tracking active SSTables instead of scanning the entire data directory.

## Resume Line

> Built LSMKV, a distributed key-value database from scratch featuring a custom LSM-tree storage engine with MemTable, SSTables, sparse indexing, Bloom Filters, Write-Ahead Logging, and compaction. Extended with consistent hashing-based routing in the client SDK, synchronous replication, and heartbeat-based failure detection. Benchmarked against Redis across multiple workload profiles and documented performance trade-offs. Inspired by RocksDB, LevelDB, Cassandra, and Redis internals while implementing every storage engine component from scratch.

## Non Goals
This project intentionally does not implement:
- Raft
- Paxos
- MVCC
- SQL Query Engine
- Distributed Transactions
- Gossip Protocol
- Dynamic Membership
- Read Repair
- Anti-Entropy Synchronization

The goal is to build a production-inspired LSM storage engine with a lightweight distributed layer rather than a complete production database.
